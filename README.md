In this project I've just completed a full end-to-end deployment of a Date App using top-tier DevOps tools and technologies! 
üéâ This project was an incredible learning experience that enhanced my skills in cloud deployment, automation, and containerization.

## Key Steps
Step 1 - Launch an EC2 Instance on AWS <br/>
Step 2 - Installing Jenkins file one the Instance<br/>
Step 3 - Install Docker and Start the SonarQube Container<br/>
Step 4 - Access the SonarQube Server<br/>
Step 5 - Configure the Jenkins server<br/>
Step 6 - Setup the Trivy for Scanning Image and App<br/>
Step 7 - Setup Jenkins Pipeline<br/>
